A sudoku app with variable difficuilty, complete with option to resume.
Sudoku genration involves the following steps:
1. Creating a random valid grid, initially full.
2. Remove an element at a random location, check if the sudoku contains a unique solution by solving it multiple times.
3. Enough elements are removed until the sudoku matches the diffucilty.
